	  that woud require the grader to protect lucas but at the cost of losing his wife who he had died ten days after the deal. Lucas was raised inside of their 
	  chocolates castle home and was never allowed outside due to fear of losing lucas as well. When lucas was 9 and 1/2 he was able to convice mint to take him
