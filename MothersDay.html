                    <p>

                        Thank you mom for everything you've done for me. You've been there for me through
                        thick and thin. You have been one of my rolemodels all my life and you've also
                        helped me make many different difficult decisions. Again, thank you for everything that
                        you've done and I want you to know to know that I love you with all my Heart.


                    </p>
