                Originally I was gonna make a comic book like thing that you had to read through but I found it too complicating. So i'm going to do
                this in the easiest and best way possible. Thank you so so much for being there for me and being a father figure when I had none. When I
                nothing you appreared and filled in the hole in my heart and while this sounds corny i'm being serious. You pushed me to do things that I
                never thought of doing before such as trying to make my own website. Sometimes it may seem as though I don't care about you when I go
                downstairs to eat and don't talk to you at all or when you invite me to do something and I decline. It's not because I despise you or I hate you
                but it's because I don't really know what to do as i'm still not used to having a permanent father figure. I want you to remember this though
                as jose tries to come back into my life, You are my father and all the love I had for him is now yours and nothing he does will change that.
                Just to close this off I want to say for the 500th time that i'm thankful and that I love you and I hope you have a good fathers day.
